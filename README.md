gamepads in javascript
======================

works on chrome, kinda works on firefox - the gamepad data seems to be sent to the server but it doesn't print correctly

to run:

    npm install
    npm start

also, make sure you press a button on the gamepad beforehand because iirc apparently the browser can't detect that you actually have a gamepad connected unless you press something
